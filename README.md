# pet-task-tracker
Android application to help households manage routine pet care tasks.
- Create and update users and their pets
- Create tasks for a pet and assign them to a user
- Mark tasks as complete
- Easily reassign a task to a different user
- Uses [Loopj](http://loopj.com/android-async-http/) and [Volley](https://github.com/google/volley) for async and scheduled HTTP requests
- Works with [Pet Task Tracker web app](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/dregalbuto/pet-task-tracker-web-app) to post and fetch data from a relational database, so every change is quickly reflected on each instance of the app
- My first Android project :)
